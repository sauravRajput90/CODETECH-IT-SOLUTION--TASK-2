# OBJECTIVE 
To improve the company’s understanding of its customers in terms of their buying behavior and buying characteristics through the segmentation models. Precisely, the project objectives involve achieving segmentation and clustering of customers, tailored product positioning and marketing communication strategies, as well as increasing the providers’ value for the individual clients.
# Key Tasks
Data cleaning and preprocessing  
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to describe features of the data  
Transformation of existing variables to develop more suitable variables  
Clustering methods that can be applied in segmenting the customers include the K-means and the hierarchical clustering.  
Customer segmentation for each segment  
Evaluation of segmentation results  
Also, it escalates the probability of developing appropriate promotional techniques to appeal to the various categories.
# Expected Outcomes
Thus, the identification of key customer segments  
Customer behavior knowledge or awareness of customer’s behavior.  
Some suggestions to enhance the activity in the sphere of customer acquisition and customer retention  
Knowledge about the performance of the products and the grouping of products that have to be put on the shelf.
# Additional Considerations
Dataset Details: In two lines mention the data (name, where the data is collected from, size and few important variables).  
Tools and Technologies: What is the programming language used and tools used? (e.g. Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
Visualizations: Specify which of the designed types of visualizations are being/planned to be used (e. g., histogram, scatter plot, heatmap).  
Metrics: Explain characteristics of measurements utilized for the assessment of cluster models; (e. g. Silhouette coefficient, Calinski – Harabasz index).
